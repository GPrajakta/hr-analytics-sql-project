## 🗃️ Database Schema

| Table | Rows | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `employees` | ~300,000 | Core employee records |
| `salaries` | ~2.8M | Full salary history per employee |
| `titles` | ~443,000 | Job title history per employee |
| `dept_emp` | ~331,000 | Department assignments per employee |
| `departments` | 9 | Department master list |
| `dept_manager` | 24 | Department manager assignments |

> **Key Pattern:** Active records use `to_date = '9999-01-01'`. Historical records have an actual end date. All queries filter on this.

## 📊 Key Findings

> Full findings with supporting data in [docs/key_findings.md](docs/key_findings.md)

### 1. Attrition is concentrated in early tenure
Employees who leave do so most frequently within their first 2–3 years. Departments with high attrition share a common pattern: no title change in the first 24 months. This suggests promotion velocity directly impacts retention.

### 2. A measurable gender pay gap exists
Analysis using `PERCENT_RANK()` and `CASE WHEN` pivot logic reveals a consistent 4–8% salary gap across most departments, even when controlling for title and tenure. The gap widens at senior levels.

### 3. ~12% of current staff are flight risks
Using the criteria: tenure ≥ 5 years AND no title change AND salary below department median — approximately 12% of current employees meet the flight risk threshold across all departments.

### 4. Salary growth has slowed since 1995
Year-over-year salary growth averaged 3.2% from 1985–1995, dropping to 1.8% from 1995 onward — below typical inflation benchmarks, suggesting compensation erosion for long-tenured employees.

## 🛠️ SQL Techniques Used

| Technique | Used In |
|-----------|---------|
| Common Table Expressions (CTEs) | Attrition rate, flight risk, salary YoY |
| Window Functions (`LAG`, `LEAD`, `PERCENT_RANK`, `ROW_NUMBER`) | YoY growth, top earners, tenure |
| Pivot with `CASE WHEN` | Gender pay gap |
| Multi-table JOINs (4–5 tables) | Most queries |
| `'9999-01-01'` current-record filter | All queries |
| `TIMESTAMPDIFF` / `DATEDIFF` | Tenure, age |
| Subqueries | Age distribution, flight risk |
